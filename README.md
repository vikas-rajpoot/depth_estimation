# Depth Estimation of the single images with Transfer Learning pretrained MobileNetV2

This project implements a deep learning neural network model to generate the depth image of a given image.
Model is a U-net model with MobileNetV2 as the encoder, and model has utilized skip connection from encoder to decoder.
Model generates a depth image of resolution 480x640 for input image of same size.


This project was implemented taking reference from the following paper: 

[High Quality Monocular Depth Estimation via Transfer Learning (arXiv 2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11941)
